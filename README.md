[Moonlight for Android](https://moonlight-stream.org) is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield.

Moonlight for Android will allow you to stream your full collection of games from your Windows PC to your Android device,
whether in your own home or over the internet.

Moonlight also has a [PC client](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-qt) and [iOS/tvOS client](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-ios).
